# Hyperverge_project-Fine-tuning-LLMs-
Finetuning Large language models for problem solving

**ðŸ“š Project Overview:**\
To empower students to leverage the power of large language models and use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to solve real-world use cases.

---
**ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement:**
- **Background:** LLMs have powerful natural language comprehension and question answering abilities.
- **Objective:** To explore the various PEFT methods to fine-tune a large language model for any of the given datasets for the task of python problem solving and coding.
- **Constraints:** We will make use of a LLama2-7B model.
